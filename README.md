# taskr_flutter

A To-Do App allowing to manage a task list by multiple people (couples, families, friends).
The App is designed using the MVP Architecture pattern. Currently it supports a local cache (SQLite DB + Shared Prefs) and an interface to an extern Backend, which will be built soon using the Flask Framework (Python).

The aim is to explore the very promising Framework Flutter, which is still in its alpha stage. Hopefully 2k18 will bring some changes.
