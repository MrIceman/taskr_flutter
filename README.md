# taskr_flutter

A To-Do App allowing to manage a task list by multiple people (couples, families, friends).<br>
The App is designed using the MVP Architecture pattern. Currently it supports a local cache<br>
(SQLite DB + Shared Prefs) and an interface to an extern Backend, which will be built soon using the Flask Framework (Python).<br>This project supports darts inbuilt http library and is making use of its POST/GET requests using JSON as format.<br>
Besides that darts async features like Future are heavily used.

The aim is to explore the very promising Framework Flutter, which is still in its alpha stage. Hopefully 2k18 will bring some changes.
